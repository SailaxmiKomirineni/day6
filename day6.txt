1. what is PEP8?
2. what are operators? What is use of walrus operator?
3. why 0.3 + 0.6 = 0.899999
4. When for loop is used and explain for loop syntax and which is exclusive and inclusive explain?

1. => PEP8 = Python Enhancement Proposal
   To develop a module or development process in python. We use pep8 guildlines for best code readibility and code written by different 
   developers should be consistent or similar pattern.
   Module: To use the code to complete a task which is used again and again. Others can access the code which is used in their development
   we send the module(code) to community. community review whether it follows PEP8 guidelines.
   PEP8 Guidelines:
   1. Indentations : 4 spaces
   2. Whitespaces  : single white space (use). No extra white spaces after brackets or parenthesis.
   3. Line Length  : max 79 characters in a line
   4. Import       : import modules in seperate line
   5. Naming Convention : use meaningfull variable. Follow
      For variables & Functions = "snake_case"
          Classes               = "CamelCase"
          Constants             = "UPPER_CASE"
   6. Comments     : write clear comments
   7.Functions and Method : Use to blank lines to seperate them.
   8.Docstrings    : use to write documentation for modules, classes, functions and methods

2. => To perform some operations between the elements we use operators like "+", "-", "/", "=", "%", "!", "&", ":=" etc
   Walrus Operator : ":="
       this operator is used only in inline statements where in some cases "=" is not possible.
   In statements like, 
              n = [1,2,3,4,5]
              if len(n)>3:      
   Here in statement twice len is calculated to calculate 1 time by storing value.
              if l := len(n) > 3:
   we can avoid redundancy = storing same data multiple time, leads decrease in storage space.

4. For loop is used to get the result from collection of elements like List, array, set, dictionary, tuple, strings.
   To iterate over a sequence of elements in the collection. 
   for i in range(len(n)):
   i -> "i" is the iterator from 0 to length of the n,where i=0,1,2,3,4,...n
   range -> range starts from 0 to length of the n.ranges are exclusive in python.

   => Inclusive Range: 
      Start point and end point are included in the range 
      Ex: range(1,5) => 1,2,3,4,5 
         ruby,swift, c#
   => Exclusive Range:
      Start point is included and end point is not included in the range
      Ex: range(1,5) => 1,2,3,4 
          python
